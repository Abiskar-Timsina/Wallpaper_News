# Wallpaper-News

Wallpaper-News is a simple script that scrapes data from news sites, adds it as a tile on the corner of the wallpaper and applies it. It updates itself after a pre-defined interval.

## Disclaimer:
This project is something I built just as a experiment. It's not yet user friendly and there are many known bugs.
1. Only works on Windows.
2. Only supports .png files as backgrounds (for now).
